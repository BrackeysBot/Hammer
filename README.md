## About
Hammer is a Discord bot which provides features to issue infractions to misbehaving users.

## Features
### Notes
Leave staff-only notes on users so that staff can keep shared notes on users without informing the user of the action.

### Warnings
Issue an infraction against a user by providing them with a warning about their behaviour.

### Tracking
Is a certain user spamming or being offensive, but deleting the evidence? Start tracking them. For a specified amount of time (or indefinitely), their actions will be logged (including message edits, message deletions, nickname changes).

## License
This bot is under the [MIT License](LICENSE.md).
